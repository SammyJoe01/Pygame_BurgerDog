# **BurgerDog**
Burger Dog is a simple 2D game where the player controls a dog trying to catch falling burgers. The game is implemented using the Pygame library in Python.

## **Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## **Prerequisites**
1. Python 3.x
2. Pygame library
3. The fonts, images and audios used in the program

## **Installing**
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
**git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/BurgerDog.git**

## **Running the Game**
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal:
python3 Burger_Dog.py

## **How to Play**
Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the dog: up, down, left, and right.
The goal of the game is to catch as many falling burgers as possible by colliding with them.
Each burger caught earns you points.
At the top of the screen, you can see your current score, remaining lives, and remaining boost level.
Press the space bar to activate a boost, which increases the dog's speed temporarily. However, be careful, as your boost level is limited.
If you miss a burger, it falls to the ground, and you lose a life. You start the game with three lives.
The game ends when you lose all your lives.
After the game is over, you can play again by pressing any key on your keyboard.

## **Customization**
You can customize the game in different ways such as:
1. Change the colors and font.
2. Create your own game assets: Such as the dog and burger images, and replace the existing images with your own.
3. Change the mechanics: Such as the speed and acceleration of the burger and the dog, to make the game more challenging or easier.
4. Add sound effects and music.
